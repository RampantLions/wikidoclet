 This is an extension of the {@link wikidoclet.standard.Standard} doclet
 provided with the JDK. It adds support for what I am calling WIKI formatting.
 What this means is that your JavaDoc can now be formatted using text rules that
 are easier on the eyes than html embedded in JavaDoc. For example, to put
 emphasis on a piece of text you surround it with *stars*. Italics with
 _underscores_. When the doclet is run to produce JavaDoc these rules are
 evaluated and html substitutions are made. This formatting should make reading
 java source code much easier since it will no longer be cluttered with HTML
 tags. This is especially true for bulleted lists and for tables. HTML is
 preserved still though, so you can mix and match as you like.

 The text formatting rules were taken from rules defined by
 [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWIKI]]
 and work the same for the most part.

 *Formatting Notes*:

    * You no longer need to embed =p= tags into source source code. WIKI formatting
      replaces blank lines with =p= tags.

    * Bulleted and numbered lists may contain list items that span multiple
      lines as long as the indent level of the text is >= the current indent
      level. Also, you may include newlines between list items.

    * The tables created by the table rule have a css class of "wikitable"
      so that the style can be manipulated.

    * The =pre/verbatim= tags will escape the html embedded with them. Example:
        <pre>
            <HTML><BODY>&amp;&amp;&amp;</BODY></HTML>
        </pre>

    * =pre/verbatim= tags must be on a line by themselves.

 The only change made to the standard doclet tags was in
 {@link wikidoclet.standard.HtmlStandardWriter}. The commentTagsToString method
 was changed to perform the WIKI replacements before returning. This class had to
 be changed since all of the other Writers use it as a base class for
 formatting.

 All of the work takes place in {@link WikiFormatter}. The Doclet API proved to
 be *FAR* less extendable than I would have liked. I ended up copying the source
 of the standard doclet into this package so I could modify the {@link
 wikidoclet.standard.HtmlStandardWriter}.
